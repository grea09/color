  abstract = {There are several formalizations for hierarchical planning. Many of them allow to specify preconditions and effects for compound tasks. They can be used, e.g., to assist during the modeling process by ensuring that the decomposition methods' plans ‘‘implement'' the compound tasks' intended meaning. This is done based on so-called legality criteria that relate these preconditions and effects to the method's plans and pose further restrictions. Despite the variety of expressive hierarchical planning formalisms, most theoretical investigations are only known for standard HTN planning, where compound tasks are just names, i.e., no preconditions or effects can be specified. Thus, up to know, a direct comparison to other hierarchical planning formalisms is hardly possible and fundamental theoretical properties are yet unknown. We therefore investigate the theoretical impact of such preconditions and effects -- depending on the legality criteria known from the literature -- for two of the most basic questions to planning: plan existence and plan verification. It turns out that for all investigated legality criteria, the respective problems are as hard as in the HTN setting and therefore equally expressive.},

In this paper, we present a domain-independent approach that combines a number of planning and interaction components to realize advanced user assistance. Based on a hybrid planning formalism, the components provide facilities including the generation, execution, and repair as well as the presentation and explanation of plans. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by means of a system that aims to assist users in the assembly of their home theater. An empirical evaluation shows the benefit of such a supportive system, in particular for persons with a lack of domain expertise.},

  abstract = {The field of deterministic AI planning can roughly be divided into two approaches - classical state-based planning and hierarchical task network (HTN) planning. The plan existence problem of the former is known to be decidable while it has been proved undecidable for the latter. When extending HTN planning by allowing the unrestricted insertion of tasks and ordering constraints, one obtains a form of planning which is often referred to as ''hybrid planning''.We present a simplified formalization of HTN planning with and without task insertion. We show that the plan existence problem is undecidable for the HTN setting without task insertion and that it becomes decidable when allowing task insertion. In the course of the proof, we obtain an upper complexity bound of EXPSPACE for the plan existence problem for propositional HTN planning with task insertion.},

This document defines a textual syntax for RDF called Turtle that allows RDF graphs to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes. Turtle provides levels of compatibility with the existing N-Triples and Notation 3 formats as well as the triple pattern syntax of the SPARQL W3C Proposed Recommendation.

This document specifies a language that is in common usage under the name "Turtle". It is intended to be compatible with, and a subset of, Notation 3.},
