The paper presents HEART, a method that combines Plan-space planning and a fragment of Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN). HEART builds on the idea of the HiPOP planner (Bechon et al.). HEART is evaluated on the Kitchen domain (from Ramirez and Geffner) showing that it can outperform the HiPOP planner.

The HEART planner produces intermediate abstract plans that are being refined until the plan contains only atomic actions. The HEART planner is designed to be real-time and hence fragments of the plan have to be executed even before planning finishes. Whereas abstract plans carry some information about their structure, it is not clear how such abstract plans can be executed. For example, if an agent (or robot) has a higher-level plan (e.g., the Level 2 plan in Figure 1), then if it comes across a method (or non-atomic action in your terminology) how the agent is supposed to execute it as the agent does not know how to decompose the method (e.g., how the agent can execute the make(tea) method). In the experiments, the quality of abstract plans is measured by the number of effects the actions (both atomic and non-atomic) produce so far. It is not, however, clear whether, for example, 60% is a good number (also some fluents might be harder to achieve). 

The choice of plan-space planning (e.g. POCL) over state-space planning techniques is not well motivated as state-space planners are much more efficient. Partially-ordered plans can be obtained from totally-ordered plans, which are generated by classical (state-space) planners, by various methods (e.g. Block deordering - Siddiqui and Haslum, 2012). Also, there are techniques that translate a fragment of HTN into classical planning (Alford et al., 2009, 2016) and could be relevant to your approach. 

In my opinion, the contribution of the paper is quite unclear, since some aspects are not very well explained (e.g. abstract plan execution, plan quality), the work is not well positioned into the related work (e.g., compared with existing HTN methods such as SHOP2) and the experiments are quite preliminary (only one rather simple problem).

This paper describes a method for solving planning problems that combines an HTN planner and a POCL planner. I think the idea is interesting, and also the motivation and potential applications. The authors indicate that this approach deals with problems that are too difficult to solve within tight time constraints. However, I do not see this in the paper. The explanations mainly focus in the POCL part, I would suggest the authors to reduce this part (because it is usually known by any researcher working in automated planning) and to explain with a deeper detail the HTN resolution.
In general, I think the paper is not very clear. For example, in listing 1, the composite actions should be detailed in their methods to better understand some examples below. Another example which is not clear is the one illustrating definition 6: it is said that "our initial plan contains two unsupported subgoals...", where? I cannot see that. 
Moreover, notations in table 1 are hardly explained in the paper, although they are used. I would suggest the authors to simplify some notations and give a general idea of how the method works, mainly in section IV, which is the most important section of the paper. For example, I do not see how the atomic actions of two composite actions are combined when these composite actions are decomposed. I mean, I assume that they are not necessarily sequential actions and that they can be interleaved and, more than that, an action of a composite action can threat an action of another composite action. This should be explained more clearly in the paper.
Finally, I do not understand what the authors want to show with the experimental results. And the domains that are used should be detailed. It is indicated that these domains does not contain negative effects, which are usually the most complicated part of planning problems. Therefore, I do not clearly see the scope of this approach.
