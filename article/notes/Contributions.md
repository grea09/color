# List of possible contributions

* Usefullness based heuristic for POP
* Advanced goal selection strategy based on heuristic and on domain causal graph
* ~~Reforced protections against existing defects (cycles, liar links, toxic actions)~~ (used; maybe in online recognition)
* A flaw selection strategy for threats (first solve all related subgoals)
* Two new negative flaws for plan quality improvement.
* ~~Soft solving using domain oriented fixing~~ (needs more work)
* ~~Efficient online planning using POP's replanning ability~~ (already done)
* ~~Introducing the WORLD language : a pseudo RDF language with possible query system that supports STRIPS~~ (used)
* ~~Adding constraint planning in order to do plan recognition~~
* ~~Multiple goal recognition using Ramirez + Chen + Proper plan correlation index~~
